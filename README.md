# Kurt Soncco Sinchi's PhD Research Portfolio

Welcome! I am a PhD Candidate in the `Department of Civil and Environmental ENgineering` at the **University of California, Berkeley**, advised by Professor Mohamad Hallal.

My research, situated at the intersection of `Geotechnical Engineering` and `Machine Learning`, focuses on `robust surrogated earthquate physical simulators and probabilsitic spatial correlated generation of site analysis`. This repository serves as a central portfolio connecting the various research projects I am leading or contributing to during my doctoral studies, as well as collaboration I have been part of!
